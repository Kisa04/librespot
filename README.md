# spotify-zeroconf
### Spotify Web API authentication, the easy way.

## About this library

`spotify-zeroconf` is a partial rewrite of [`librespot`](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) that has one goal:

**To provide you with a Spotify Web API token without having to input your username and password.**

## How does it work

Basically, this library takes advantage of the [`Spotify Connect`](https://www.spotify.com/connect/) protocol and brodcasts itself as a Spotify compatible device on your network. Once you click on the device using any Spotify client (desktop, mobileâ€¦), it will perform multiple handshakes and authentication rounds with the Spotify access points, and provide you with a token that you will be able to use with the [`Spotify Web API`](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).

There are more details in the `librespot` wiki (especially the [Authentication](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Authentication) and [Connection](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Connection) parts).

## Installation

```bash
npm i spotify-zeroconf
```

## Usage

```js
const spotifyZeroconf = require('spotify-zeroconf')

// Only clientId is required.
const credentials = await spotifyZeroconf({
    clientId: // [Required] Id of your spotify application
    scope: // Scopes with a comma separator. Defaults to a list containing every scope. (see here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/scopes/)
    deviceName: // Name of the device that appears on the network. Defaults to 'Spotify Zeroconf'.
    noCache: // If true, will not store the first handshake credentials and will force the device to appear on the network every time the function is called. Defaults to false.
})

// Web API token.
console.log(credentials.accessToken)
```
